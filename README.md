# PassGen- Password Generator

## Description

- This third challenge helped me test my knowledge and understanding of Javascript concepts.

- It also helped me understand how Javascript executes commands to make websites feel more interactive.

- Although not related, it also helped me find the help I needed to finish my assingment in time, which in itself was an invaluable lesson.
